# Elite: Dangerous Plugin

**Note that this module only works with Elite: Dangerous Horizons. It does not support the Odessey expansion.**

This plugin adds a profile module for Elite: Dangerous.

A data model is included which reads data that is output by the game to the journal and status files. No additional mods or tools are required.

With thanks to [elite-journal.readthedocs.io](https://elite-journal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which provided a list of all the events and fields that may appear in the player journal.
